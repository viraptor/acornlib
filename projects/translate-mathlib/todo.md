# Acornlib Math Roadmap

Goal: over time, give Acornlib a reasonable analogue of each major area of mathematics covered in Lean Mathlib, with work ordered roughly by dependency.

## Blockers

- [ ] acorn-bug: linear-algebra/modules-and-vector-spaces - structures with 3 typeclass
      parameters (e.g. `ModuleHom[R: Ring, M: AddCommGroup, N: AddCommGroup]`) generate
      certificates that fail strict `acorn check` ("generated invalid code: Argument 0
      has type ModuleHom[AddCommGroup, Ring, Ring], but expected ModuleHom[Ring,
      AddCommGroup, AddCommGroup]"). Reproducible via field accessors `.src`/`.dst`/`.hom`
      on such a struct. Next action: report upstream with a minimal repro, then revisit
      bundled `ModuleHom` once fixed.

## Foundational And Core Infrastructure

- [ ] [Foundations and set-theoretic infrastructure](foundations/todo.md)
  Note: strengthen sets, relations, functions, quotients, finite/infinite constructions, and reusable proof infrastructure.

- [ ] [Order theory and lattices](order-theory/todo.md)
  Note: complete the general API for partial orders, linear orders, lattices, complete lattices, monotone maps, and Galois connections.

- [ ] [Algebraic hierarchy](algebraic-hierarchy/todo.md)
  Note: continue building semigroups, monoids, groups, rings, fields, morphisms, subobjects, quotients, and canonical instances.

- [ ] [Linear algebra](linear-algebra/todo.md)
  Note: add modules, vector spaces, linear maps, bases, dimension theory, duality, matrices, determinants, and bilinear forms.

- [ ] [Category theory](category-theory/todo.md)
  Note: introduce categories, functors, natural transformations, limits, adjunctions, monads, and standard categorical abstractions used across Mathlib.

## Algebra And Number Systems

- [ ] [Commutative algebra](commutative-algebra/todo.md)
  Note: add ideals, quotient rings, localization, Noetherianity, integral extensions, tensor products, and spectra-oriented infrastructure.

- [ ] [Field theory and Galois theory](field-theory-and-galois-theory/todo.md)
  Note: cover algebraic extensions, splitting fields, algebraic closures, finite fields, separability, and Galois correspondences.

- [ ] [Representation theory and Lie algebra basics](representation-theory-and-lie-algebra/todo.md)
  Note: support group representations, characters, module decompositions, Lie algebras, and basic Lie-theoretic constructions.

- [ ] [Number theory](number-theory/todo.md)
  Note: expand elementary and algebraic number theory, including arithmetic functions, Diophantine results, local fields, and reciprocity-style theorems.

- [ ] [Special number systems](special-number-systems/todo.md)
  Note: extend support for complex numbers, extended reals, p-adics, and other standard completions and enriched scalar systems.

## Topology, Analysis, And Measure

- [ ] [Topology](topology/todo.md)
  Note: add topological spaces, continuity, compactness, connectedness, separation axioms, product and quotient topologies, and dense embeddings.

- [ ] [Uniform spaces and metric spaces](uniform-and-metric-spaces/todo.md)
  Note: add filters or a comparable abstraction for limits, uniform continuity, completions, and metric-space constructions.

- [ ] [Measure theory](measure-theory/todo.md)
  Note: develop sigma-algebras, measurable functions, measures, integration, product measures, and convergence theorems.

- [ ] [Probability theory](probability-theory/todo.md)
  Note: build probability measures, random variables, independence, expectation, convergence in law/probability, and core limit theorems.

- [ ] [Real analysis](real-analysis/todo.md)
  Note: keep extending sequences, series, continuity, differentiability, integration, asymptotics, and classical theorems on real functions.

- [ ] [Functional analysis](functional-analysis/todo.md)
  Note: add normed spaces, Banach and Hilbert spaces, bounded linear maps, operator theory, and dual spaces.

- [ ] [Complex analysis](complex-analysis/todo.md)
  Note: add holomorphic functions, power series, contour integration, residue theory, and complex-analytic standard library theorems.

## Geometry And Higher Structure

- [ ] [Affine, Euclidean, and convex geometry](affine-euclidean-and-convex-geometry/todo.md)
  Note: support affine spaces, subspaces, spans, inner product spaces, orthogonality, angles, convexity, and polytopal constructions.

- [ ] [Differential geometry and manifolds](differential-geometry-and-manifolds/todo.md)
  Note: add smooth manifolds, tangent bundles, smooth maps, differential forms, Riemannian structures, and Lie groups.

- [ ] [Algebraic geometry](algebraic-geometry/todo.md)
  Note: develop prime spectra, Zariski topology, sheaves, locally ringed spaces, schemes, and standard scheme-theoretic constructions.

## Discrete Mathematics And Dynamical Systems

- [ ] [Combinatorics](combinatorics/todo.md)
  Note: cover counting arguments, extremal combinatorics, finite set systems, partitions, generating functions, and incidence structures.

- [ ] [Graph theory](graph-theory/todo.md)
  Note: add simple graphs, walks, connectivity, coloring, matchings, flows, adjacency matrices, and spectral graph basics.

- [ ] [Dynamical systems and ergodic ideas](dynamical-systems-and-ergodic-ideas/todo.md)
  Note: support iterative dynamics, fixed and periodic points, omega-limit sets, invariant measures, and basic ergodic statements.
